## When to Load References

| Trigger | Files to load | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| button asks | references/components/button.md | per-component file |

This prescription text leaks <https://github.com/example/repo> on purpose;
the produced-mode check must NOT scan for that pattern.

In scope: tokens, assets, component descriptions, component APIs.

# extraction floor to a post-emit gate. Setup is descriptive (read once at
# greenfield wiring time); `## Hard rules` is the contract checked at every
# emit. When Setup ships a wiring construct (provider mount, `### Companion CSS`
# subheading, or `### Foundation wiring` subheading), the produced SKILL.md
# must emit at least one Hard Rule whose body matches shell vocabulary
# (body|root|html|provider|wrap|theme|color-scheme|surface) AND references a
# token shape (`var(--...)` or the `<surface-*>` placeholder). Plus a cross-
# check: each cited `shell/<slug>` resolves to a row in produced anti-patterns.md.
# See PRD-shell-invariants.md and references/anti-patterns.md Layer C
# `shell/unpainted-body`, `shell/mode-attribute-no-theme-import`,
# `shell/provider-missing-content-wrap`.

# Test 41: pass — Setup ships root-entry-file + Companion CSS; Hard Rules has
# rules matching shell vocab + surface token; produced anti-patterns.md has
